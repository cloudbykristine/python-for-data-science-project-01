## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that affected passenger survival. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning to build a predictive model for survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset). It contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket details, and survival status.
